## ✨ Project Overview

Abeer-DevSpace is designed as a clean and minimal portfolio that focuses on performance, smooth animations, and clear content structure.  
The project reflects my interest in front-end development, UI design, and creating engaging user experiences.

---

## 🧠 Code Structure & Architecture

The project is built using **Next.js**, which provides:
- File-based routing
- Optimized performance
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Clean project organization

### Main Structure:
- **pages/** → Handles routing and main views
- **components/** → Reusable UI components
- **styles/** → CSS styling files
- **public/** → Static assets such as images and icons

The code follows a **component-based approach**, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

## 🎞️ Animations (GSAP)

I used **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** to create smooth and controlled animations across the website.

### Why GSAP?
- High performance animations
- Precise timeline control
- Smooth transitions and effects
- Better control compared to pure CSS animations

### Usage Examples:
- Animating text on page load
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Enhancing user interaction without affecting performance

GSAP is integrated inside React components using lifecycle hooks to ensure animations run at the correct time.
